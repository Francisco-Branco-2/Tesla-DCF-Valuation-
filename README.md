# Tesla-DCF-Valuation

This project implements an automated financial valuation model for Tesla (TSLA), applying the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) in Excel. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust sensitivity analysis that indicates whether the stock is currently undervalued or overvalued, serving as a practical tool for investment decisions driven by economic fundamentals rather than market speculation.
